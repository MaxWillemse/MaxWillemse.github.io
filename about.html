<h1 style="color: white"> <b> What is VR?</b> </h1>
<p style="color: white"> Virtual Reality (VR) is a computer-generated environment with scenes and objects <br>
  that appear to be real, making the user feel they are immersed in their<br>
  surroundings. This environment is perceived through a device known as a Virtual<br>
  Reality headset or helmet. <br>


  <br>
  Although this may seem extremely futuristic, its origins are not as recent as we <br>
  might think. In fact, many people consider that one of the first Virtual Reality <br>
    devices was called Sensorama, a machine with a built-in seat that played 3D <br>
    movies, gave off odours and generated vibrations to make the experience as vivid <br>
    as possible. The invention dates back as far as the mid-1950s. Subsequent <br>
    technological and software developments over the following years brought with <br>
    them a progressive evolution both in devices and in interface design.<br>

    <h2 style="color: white"> <b> How is it used in everyday life?</b> </h2>
    <p style="color: white"> VR is being used everyday, all over the world. It is being used in healthcare, in <br>
      business, in education, in the military, in sports and mostly in gaming. For example <br>
    the last two years, because of the pandemic, the numbers of people with mental  <br>
    health problems has heavily increased. To improve and decrease the numbers of <br>
    people who struggle with mental health problems, VR was applied.<br>

  <h3 style="color: white"> <b> VR with AR and the differences </b> </h3>
  <p style="color: white"> Despite being a technology that originated decades ago, many people are still <br>
    unfamiliar with the concept of Virtual Reality. It is also quite common to confuse <br>
    the term Virtual Reality with augmented reality. The main difference between the <br>
    two is that VR builds the world in which we immerse ourselves through a specific <br>
      headset. It is fully immersive and everything we see is part of an environment <br>
      artificially constructed through images, sounds, etc. On the other hand, in <br>
      augmented reality (AR), our own world becomes the framework within which <br>
      objects, images or similar are placed. Everything we see is in a real environment <br>
      and it may not be strictly necessary to wear a headset. The clearest and most <br>
      mainstream example of this concept is Pokémon Go.<br>
      However, there is also a combination of both realities called mixed reality. This <br>
      hybrid technology makes it possible, for example, to see virtual objects in the real <br>
      world and build an experience in which the physical and the digital are practically <br>
      indistinguishable.<br>
