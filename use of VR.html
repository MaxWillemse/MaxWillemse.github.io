<h1 style="color: white"> VR usage </h1>
<p style="color: white">
  VR is mostly seen as under developed gaming device, but many instances have already started expirimenting with this new tech.<br>
  Wheter it is a student learning how to do surgery, a pilot rookie's simulating actual flight, or the army training their soldiers for battle.<br>
  VR is getting more mainstream and clearly marks a path for the future, here are some case where it is already in use.<br>
</p>
<br>

  <b style="font-size:25px;">&bull; military Usage </b><br>
  The military in the UK and the US have both adopted the use of virtual reality in <br>
  their training as it allows them to undertake a huge range of simulations. VR is <br>
  used in all branches of service: the army, navy, air force, marines and coast <br>
  guard. The military uses it for flight simulations, battlefield simulations, medic <br>
  training, vehicle simulation and virtual boot camp, among other things. VR is a <br>
  completely immersive, visual and sound-based experience, which can safely <br>
  replicate dangerous training situations to prepare and train soldiers, without <br>
  putting them at risk until they are ready for combat. Likewise, it can also be used <br>
  to teach soldiers some softer skills, including communication with local civilians or  <br>
  international counterparts when out in the field.<br>

  <br>
    <b style="font-size:25px;">&bull; Medical Usage </b><br>
    Due to its interactive nature, medical and dental students have begun using VR  <br>
    to practice surgeries and procedures, allowing for a consequence free learning  <br>
    environment; the risk of inflicting harm or making a mistake while practicing on   <br>
    real patients is eliminated. Virtual patients are used to allow students to develop <br>
    skills which can later be applied in the real world. Using VR technology in the <br>
    medical industry is an effective way to not only improve the quality of students in <br>
    training but it also presents a great opportunity to optimize costs, especially <br>
    since health services are continuously under pressure with tight budgets.<br>
<br>
<br>
  <b style="font-size:25px;">&bull; Mental Health Usage </b><br>
  Mental health is very important to your well-being. How you view the world is <br>
  how you're going to live in it. VR has been used to treat anxiety, post-traumatic <br>
  stress disorder (PTSD), and addictions. That's how it's been used in psychology. <br>
  VR can transport a trainee into a number of different situations, places and <br>
  environments for a range of training purposes. The military uses it for flight <br>
  simulations, battlefield simulations, medic training, vehicle simulation and virtual <br>
  boot camp, among other things.<br>
<br>
<br>
  <b style="font-size:25px;">&bull; School Usage </b><br>
   VR uses for education don’t stop at the military or medical field, but extend to <br>
   schools with virtual reality also adopted in education for teaching and learning <br>
   situations. Students are able to interact with each other and within a <br>
   three-dimensional environment. They can also be taken on virtual field trips, for <br>
   example, to museums, taking tours of the solar system and going back in time to <br>
   different eras. Virtual reality can be particularly beneficial for students with <br>
   special needs, such as autism. Research has found that VR can be a motivating <br>
   platform to safely practice social skills for children <br>
